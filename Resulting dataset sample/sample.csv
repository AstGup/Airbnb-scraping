Everyone agreed we would be very glad to return to this house. We echo all the positives people describe, so my review is mostly to provide info we didn't have from the reviews that would have been helpful.  Naama, the host, was always very quick to respond to messages but utilizes a property manager for things during the stay.  The property manager was also responsive.  They communicate by text message.  My husband had international data turned on while traveling but if we hadn't it would have been difficult to coordinate check in.  We cooked most meals at the house and found the kitchen sufficient to do so.  Wifi was about 80% reliable.  At night (more than one night) the wifi cut out.  While the house guide provides some good info re local attractions be sure to use GPS when you get on the road.

Our family of four (2 adults+ 16 and 4 year old) enjoyed the stunning views and accommodations at Naama's. The house is very private and is surrounded by the sounds of the rainforest. The check"", 'in and overall communication with property managers was quick and helpful. Cristina was always a text away with any questions about the property or activities. We especially appreciated the wildlife on property, amazing view, the pool, layout of home', 'so much natural light, laundry on premises, activity suggestions in area found in a binder at the home, and having a cooler to use for beach outings. The bugs were no big deal, and not an intrusion in to the home if you keep screens closed. The nearby beach, Playa Matapalo, was delightful and ended up one of our favorites. Strongly recommend the waterfall Eco Chantales, and rafting at Rafiki Safari lodge.**', '**KellyJanuary 2020Our stay at Naama’s house was wonderful. Her home is perfectly located, secluded and away from tourists but close enough to everything. Our favorite towns were Dominical and Uvita, both a short drive away. You will feel like a local in your own slice of paradise up in the mountains. Everything was very clean, beautiful and as pictured. We loved how private and quiet it was. Playa matapalo is just 5 minutes away and chances are you will have the beach to yourself. Plenty of great restaurants in the area, La Parcela was our favorite. Don’t go crazy planning every detail, just get to the house, relax and check out Naama’s binders in the living room with recommended beaches, waterfalls, restaurants and excursions. Don’t be intimidated by the bugs! Like anywhere in the world, as long as you keep the screens shut and clean up after yourself you won’t have any bugs inside the house. Due to the altitude, the air is much more comfortable by the house than down at sea level. Between the atmosphere and great ventilation of the house, the temperature was always pleasant. Her house managers Cristina and Eric were both very helpful in making our stay comfortable, both only a text message away. Prior to arriving, Naama arranged for us to have private chefs. She put us in touch with Sharon and Priscilla of TropicalTaste. We stayed in touch through email and planned all the appetizers, dinners and desserts before arriving. They offer diverse dishes, brought the necessary ingredients and all of the food was AMAZING. I highly recommend having them for your stay. Don’t hesitate to book Naama’s house, we felt very safe the entire time and loved our stay.**', '**LibbyJanuary 2020This stylish and modern home is perfectly situated to take advantage of amazing views from all rooms and the outdoor living space.  Naama was great at communicating, as was Christina, her property manager.  The home is beautiful and comfortable, but could use additional seating in living area and around the pool.  Location near the small\ntown of Matapao was perfect, very empty and beautiful beach without the crowds of Uvita and Domenical, easy access to al the area activities. Highly recommend!!**', '**MeganDecember 2019We don’t always leave reviews but in this case we wanted people to know that this is an exceptional experience. This house is Amazing! The space is just so well laid out. It could not have been more functional for what you want on your tropical vacation. The views were unbelievable. The AC and internet worked great. The water was clean and safe to drink and the washer/dryer and dishwasher made tidying up convenient. Our kids lived in the pool. The outdoor shower was great for washing the sand off after the beach. We loved it here more than dozens of rental homes we’ve stayed at all over the world. Thank you!**', '**ChalanciaNovember 2019The house it self was nice, only thing that got me was the hill (which it was stated that it was a hill but that hill to me was veryyyy dangerous and also THE BUGS I understand that we are in a forest but the bugs were everywhere.... the kitchen, bedroom, in the bed, bathroom, living room everywhere... (bugs as in ants, cockroaches, flying bugs) all kind... the pictures will make the house look very better even though it was old modern, the beds and everything overall it was fair for a square.

Absolutely stunning in the winter but also famous for its spring and summers. The city blends nature, culture, architecture, and pluralism in a way I’ve never seen. We had watched a sunset at the beautiful Saint Joseph’s oratory on Mount Royale when we booked to stay with Florent. Staying with Florent was as the old cliché puts it, simply to good to be true. His place is very close by Mount Royale and within walking distance of some beautiful cafes and delicious food spots. Florent was incredibly accessible to us from the beginning of booking, communicating with us by phone answering any questions we had about the surrounding area. When we arrived he assisted us with parking which was available for free right behind his apartment and safe from any regulation. His apartment was beautiful, incredibly clean and well kept, and our private room was comfortable well furnished and spacious. He told us we could come and go as we pleased. After returning from a night of axe throwing, we sat down with Florent and his room mate and engaged in an incredibly colorful, hysterical, and informational chat for several hours. We were laughing so much and it was so much fun we didn’t want it to end. My only regret is that I forgot to ask for a selfie.

Then to make things even better Maria offered us breakfast service (for a more than reasonable fee) and I had the first black coffee ever and it was so delicious. \nWe did end up visiting the Los Angeles Cloud Forest (40 mins drive from here)  and it would have fallen short of what we were able to experience at Maria's place.

There are day trips to volcanos, coffee plantations and so much more. \nThe only thing to be aware of is that the wind does howl through the house"", "" but that's such a small price to pay for the luxury of experiencing the Cloud Forest setting. \nWe met Maria and Felix's sons and they speak excellent English and are well mannered and charming young adults.

The guest suite is basically an annex of the main house so you have total independence and privacy with your own entrance. A communal laundry room separates the annex/suite from the main family house, so you have the best of both worlds with the family right next door whenever you need anything.

It was very convenient to get to anywhere we wanted to go. There is an excellent Venezuelan restaurant a couple of doors down (Patacon Pisao) and a good Greek restaurant very nearby. We took the short walk to Chinatown twice. The place was also clean with no evidence of any bugs or vermin. The bathroom was roomy. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the rooms we booked both had full"", 'sized beds (one of the rooms looked like it had a twin in the photo). There were lots of toiletries in the bathroom. Both of our bedrooms had separate locks and keys. The beds were comfortable, and the temperature was just right.\nThe Bad:  The main thing, and the reason I would not stay here again, is that the main door to the apartment has two locks that can only be locked/unlocked from the inside. Because of this, we were locked out twice in our 5', ""night stay. One of the locks can be set very easily, and I believe the housekeeper set it when she was there for security but did not unset it when she left. Luckily, both times, there was someone else inside the apartment to let us in. If no one had been inside the apartment, there would've been no way for anyone to get in without removing the door or the doorknob. Other small inconveniences:  The apartment has no coffee pot. The wi"", ""fi didn't work. Stella said it worked for the housekeeper, but it didn't work on my device or my friend's, so I believe the password posted on the refrigerator was wrong. There was only one washcloth and one hand towel for the entire apartment (of three separately"", ""rented areas). There were extra bath towels, but no extra wash cloths or hand towels. We did ask for some, but it seemed like there was a language barrier, and we never received any (although we asked for and received a roll of paper towels).

À tous problèmes que j'ai rencontrés, j'ai trouvé de l'aide et des solutions avec eux. \nLe logement est très propre, situé au calme dans un beau quartier. On trouve tout ce dont on a besoin à proximité. J'apprécie tout particulièrement le magasin de fruits et de légumes juste à côté. Le lieu est facilement accessible par Uber et Careem.

It takes not much more than 30 minutes to walk into the heart of the city, and there are also regular buses to take you there. Herne Bay itself is delightful. An easy walk along Jervois Road takes you to the busier area of Ponsonby Road. Herne Bay is more laid back and replete with great restaurants and coffee shops.\n\nJan and Bill are wonderful hosts and excellent communicators. I couldn't recommend them more highly.**"", '**JulieAugust 2018I love to staying here. It was so cozy and welcoming.  Check in was a breeze and Jan and Bill were very responsive hosts. The only thing that I would mention is if you are going to take a taxi service from the airport to the apartment make sure that the driver is taking you to address number 39 unit 11. I discovered that the address is formatted correctly but when taxi drivers use (Hidden by Airbnb) to find it it tells them to go to street number 11.\nIn the evenings I would wrap myself in a blanket and turn the electric heater on and watch television and just relax on the couch. Then I would move the  heater into the bedroom and close the door and my bedroom was toasty warm for when I went to sleep. Also a nice touch for the colder winter weather was an electric mattress pad heater. Very comfortable bed and quality linens.\nThe bathroom was really nice and also had a washer and dryer for use. The shower was excellent. Strong water pressure and really hot water.\nI loved being able to look out the windows and see the beautiful Herne Bay and the sunsets. Being on the top floor always s plus for me. \nThe neighborhood is quaint and safe. The the taxi driver remarked to me ""oh wow you\'re staying in a really nice neighborhood"" when he dropped me off.\nCatching the bus was easy. There\'s a bus stop close by.  I rode the bus almost everyday to the CDB. It was only $3.50 each way.  There are many restaurants, local businesses and even an excellent Chinese take away place all on the main road. There\'s also a small grocery store on that same street but I had no problem finding everything that I needed for 8 days to eat.\nA really nice touch was finding fresh fruit and milk waiting for me when I arrived.\nThe only thing that I would add to the kitchen tools would be a dish rack to put freshly washed dishes in to dry. I used a towel and then leaned the dishes one on top the other so that they would dry overnight.\nI had a wonderful stay at this apartment. I would definitely stay again in the future.

I have stayed in 30 airbnb rentals and this was the dirtiest one upon arrival.  It was only $50 per night so I decide it was not worth complaining about after a long day of travel but I would expect the toilets to be cleaned, the shelves to be dusted, and the old towel to be removed from the bathroom. I would also expect the pile of old shoes not to be the first thing you see when you arrive in the small studio. The balcony had a great view but the photos do not show that there are rundown particle board shelves on the balcony that are not appeasing to the eye as well as used bottles and an old washing machine being used for a garbage bin that would benefit from cleaning the lid.  The linens for the sofa bed had a small blanket which was not large enough for two people so I would recommend if the apartment is meant for two people to get a queen size duvet and comforter or two duvets/comforters.

You turn the faucet on (it goes harder than you'd think, and a little goes a long way) and adjust the temperature before turning the little nozzle sticking out of the spout, diverting water to the shower head, it comes out with a LOT of pressure if you turn the things up.

You can bathe, you can shower, you can have a secret adventure like you're five years old again "", "" whatever you want. It was definitely the best shower/bath experience I have ever had on any trip I've taken so far on here. No matter how much money someone spends on a bathroom, what really matters is whether or not you can get yourself hosed down and ready to either go to bed or go outside for the day: and this bathroom lets you do that, easily, with a level of no"", ""frills precision that I haven't seen or felt in a long time. The soap, shampoo and conditioner Fang was nice enough to provide were incredible. Also, the toilet has a large/small flush power selector. It's the kind where you have to hold it for a few seconds until you feel it go. There's a ton of good (soft, yet sturdy) toilet paper available, and since the toilet is literally right where the tub is, you're always going to be as clean as you need to be. After you get out of the bathroom, the kitchen is right there too, in case you need to grab a drink, or something from the fridge, or if you want to cook something "", "" there's a single"", ""burner gas stove! Make sure you take care of your trash, too, by the way: there's a nice poster on the inside of the door that tells you what days of the week and how many times per month they come by to pick up whatever kinds of trash, and what kind of bag it can be in and all kinds of stuff. You have to either follow this rule exactly by law or take all your trash out with you when you leave the apartment, so be aware of what to do in both cases "", "" you'll find this anywhere in Japan if you aren't staying in a hotel, but just in case you didn't know that already, it makes sense to mention it here. Entering the living room, you'll see two long soft beds, both with ample power outlets (2"", ""prong; bring a 3P adapter, go to Yodobashi) and shelving, and if you look above you'll discover the ceilings are ridiculously tall "", '', ' possibly up to 4.5 meters high ', '', "" and above you, what you thought was the ceiling of the entire house actually ended up being the floor above you, running the entire length of the house: an absolutely enormous loft. There was no ladder, at the time when I was there, but there would easily be enough room to sleep several people on futons if it was still set up as the traditional bedroom configuration. The real ceiling of the apartment isn't very high off that second floor, though: you'd be kneeling or crouching or crawling, depending on how tall you are, so there's no real use being up there. So, right now, it's being used for storage: but there's more than enough room to store things like your luggage and any larger items. This is, first and foremost, a place to sleep and recharge, for one or two people, before heading out for the day. If you have a laptop or tablet, use it: Fang has graciously provided free wifi, and it's fast. There's a small fridge to store your drinks and leftovers, and the place is sturdy and soundproof. I know this because there was a typhoon going on outside, Typhoon #24, and with 42mph winds I didn't hear or feel a thing until I stepped outside out of curiosity and saw/heard a street sign being ripped away and rolling down the street. Luckily, you're in the lee of the building "", '', ' so you won\'t be pelted by tons of wind and stuff while you\'re at the door. So I stepped back and went back to bed, and slept like a baby, without hearing a thing outside. My point here is, you don\'t have to worry about anything other than whatever you\'re doing on your trip in Japan, because Fang\'s apartment let me get in the door, noodle around on the internet for a few hours, and go to sleep before getting up the next day to do other things. That\'s ideally what any accommodations should be like. So here\'s how to do things: if you want to get to Akihabara, Ueno or any other major city in Japan: head towards Sugamo, then switch to the JR Yamanote line and head towards Tokyo Station, where you can go anywhere else in Japan (Shinkansen to any other major cities). If you have the JR Pass, like I did, you can easily just go anywhere else in the country on a whim within hours and then spend the entire day there, if you wake up early enough in the morning (if you consider 5am ""early""). I went to Kyoto for the day one day and spent like 12 hours there before coming back and spending another 4 hours in town in Tokyo, and I didn\'t even get up to leave THAT early.
